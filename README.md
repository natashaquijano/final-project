What was your motivation to build this project?
I've had the idea of this project for a while. For years, I've used a site called Resident Advisor to look up events. Even though it is pretty helpful, I also found myself having issues with it such as:
1. It is not very user friendly 
2. It is hard to navigate ex: no search bar
3. It is very complicated to update your location
4. It is dificult to find your upcoming events and purchases
5. It only ends up focusing on creative parties and night time events
